# Pipelines

In this workshop, we'll cover the basics of setting up a simple pipeline, consisting of git hooks and shell commands.

### Prereqs

* [Install opunit and node.js](https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/profile#opunit)
* Clone this repo with: `git clone https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/Pipelines`

### Checking progress on workshop

To help you identify if issues exist with the current setup, you can run the following command to check:

```bash
$ cd Pipelines
$ opunit verify local
```

## Pipelines

What, Why, How (events/triggers).


While more complex pipelines can be created with tools such as, Spinnaker and Jenkins, using simple tools---such as git and shell commands---can get the job done.

## Hooks

Hooks are.

Types of hooks.

order of hooks...

### Practice

Inside a new directory (`mkdir hook-demo`), create a new git repository with `git init`. Create a post-commit file located in "hook-demo/.git/hooks/post-commit". Finally, you should ensure the post-commit script is exectuable, by running `chmod +x post-commit`.

The script for post-commit might look something like this:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# In Mac
open https://google.com/
# In Windows
# start https://google.com/
# In Linux
# xdg-open https://google.com/
```

Trigger the commit by create a simple commit in hook-demo. (`touch demo`; `git add demo`; `git commit -m "init"`. You should see the webpage open.)

## A Simple Pipeline

```sh
#!/bin/sh

GIT_WORK_TREE=../production-www/ git checkout -f
SHA1=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
MSG=$(git show -s --format=%B $SHA1)
echo "Received push to production: $MSG"
```

### Something with curl...

* Webhooks?
